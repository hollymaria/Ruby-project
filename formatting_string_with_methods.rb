print "What's your first name?"

first_name = gets.chomp

first_name.capitalize!

print "What is your last name?"


last_name = gets.chomp

last_name.capitalize!

print "What is your favourite animal?"

animal = gets.chomp

animal.capitalize!

print "How many of them would you like?"

many = gets.chomp

puts "Your name is #{first_name} #{last_name}! Your favourite animal is a #{animal} and you only want #{many} of them"
